# Sentiment-Analysis based on text feedback

The goal of Sentiment Analysis is to determine how people feel about a particular subject, product, service, or experience based on the text they have written. Sentiment Analysis is typically applied to various types of text data, such as comments, reviews, social media posts, and any other form of textual communication.

In this scenario, we made a product review platform, where a customer can give their review on the product. And in the backend, we process the text-review and predict the rating of the review using our pretrained Sentiment Analysis ML Model and it will rate the review between 1 to 5 (Poor to Excellent) and then we will categorize it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE or NEUTRAL label. All these data are stored in the database.

With this, the admin can focus on negative and neutral reviews and improve the product's production. Also an automatic-mail also sent to the customer based on the review.
